Given three sticks with lengths L1, L2, L3 - find out if these sticks can form a triangle. If they can form a triangle, calculate the circumference of the triangle. Circumference of a triangle (C) = L1 + L2 + L3. The condition to be satisfied for three sticks to form a triangle is that the sum of lengths of any two sides of the triangle should be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.
